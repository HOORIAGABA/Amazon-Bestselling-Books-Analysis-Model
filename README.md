# Amazon-Bestselling-Books-Analysis-Model
**Team**: ML TEAM ALPHA

## Project Overview
This project analyzes data from Amazon's bestselling books to uncover trends, patterns, and insights. Using Python, we perform data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and statistical analysis to understand factors contributing to a book's success. The findings can support authors, publishers, and marketers in making data-driven decisions.

## Objectives
1. **Data Collection**: Gather data on Amazon’s bestselling books.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data consistency.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand distributions, relationships, and key statistics.
4. **Visualization**: Illustrate trends and patterns in the data.
5. **Statistical Analysis**: Conduct statistical tests and build models to identify factors influencing book sales.
6. **Reporting**: Compile findings into a comprehensive report with actionable insights.

## Methodology
### 1. Data Collection
   - Source data from Amazon’s bestseller list via web scraping or from datasets on platforms like Kaggle.
   - Key attributes collected include Title, Author, Price, Rating, Number of Reviews, Genre, Publication Date, and Sales Rank.

### 2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
   - Handle missing values by imputing or removing incomplete records.
   - Remove duplicates and outliers, standardize categorical data, and normalize numerical data.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculate mean, median, mode, and standard deviation.
   - **Distribution Analysis**: Visualize distributions using histograms and box plots.
   - **Correlation Analysis**: Use heatmaps to identify relationships between variables.

### 4. Visualization
   - **Bar and Pie Charts**: Display genre, author, and other categorical data distributions.
   - **Line Graphs**: Show trends over time.
   - **Scatter Plots**: Visualize relationships between variables like price and rating.

### 5. Statistical Analysis
   - **Hypothesis Testing**: Use T-tests and chi-square tests to assess significance.
   - **Regression Analysis**: Perform linear regression to identify factors predicting sales rank.
   - **Clustering**: Group similar books using K-means clustering.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, BeautifulSoup, Requests
- **IDE**: Jupyter Notebook or other Python IDEs
- **Version Control**: Git/GitHub

## Expected Outcomes
- A cleaned and well-documented dataset of Amazon bestselling books.
- Comprehensive EDA with visualizations.
- Insights into factors affecting book sales.
- A predictive model for sales rank.

## Conclusion
This project provides insights into factors that contribute to a book’s success on Amazon. By leveraging Python for data analysis, we aim to uncover patterns and trends that can inform strategies for authors, publishers, and marketers.
